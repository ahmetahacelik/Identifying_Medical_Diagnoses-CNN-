# Identifying_Medical_Diagnoses-CNN-
Please go to link (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) for the dataset. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). I've builded a model based on CNN architecture.
